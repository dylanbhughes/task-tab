# TaskTab

TaskTab is an organizer based on the principle that people doing tasks on the
internet have the same (or similar) tabs open in their browser every time they
perform that task. This Chrome extension is meant to provide an easy way for a
user to remember what pages they need to perform a particular action and to
quickly open those pages.
